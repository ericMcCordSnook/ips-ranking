9/10
X - write code for first heuristic (exploring near the mode)
X - compare results with the different optimizations we have now


9/20
X - Find rank aggregation for non-weighted version and use that as a starting point
X - Start at the various modes we have and optimize the weights for these, then
  explore the neighbors and optimize the weights for them, compare the log-likelihoods
  and move in the direction of best ranking (highest log-likelihood)
X - Run experiment where we start at different places (could be random) and do the naive
  way of moving between one node and another, and see if they converge to the same point.
  This will tell us if the landscape is smooth or not, which lets us know how important
  the starting point is.
- Research ranking combinatorial optimization.

10/4
X - Look into why b = 0 always
X - Make it so unimode greedy doesn't move only on strict greater than

10/18
- Develop Single_Mode_Greedy and Multi_Mode_Greedy and other heuristics to leverage pre-existing ones
- Figure out hierarchy for simulated dataset construction and the associated config files
- Do trials on uniform (no phi or b) as the overall baseline
- Think about how we are going to describe/solve correlation and rank aggregation in paper

10/23
- Figure out a case where we expect the unweighed model and our model to differ and show that it does
- Experiment for 5-bimode, 5-unimode, etc.
- Try experiments with fewer rankings to see if noise changes things
